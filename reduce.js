// reduce
/*
1. Use the reduce function to iterate through an array of words and construct a decoded sentence
    (string) based on the following criteria:
    a. If the array element is exactly three characters in length, add a space character to your 
    accumulator
    b. Otherwise, capitalize the LAST character of the array element and add it to your accumulator
2. Your input is: 
    a. 'noggin oreo the moon time tele steed his tent apollo her lives though shoo tofu budapest'
    b. You will need to convert the input to an array before using .reduce()

HINT: When you invoke reduce() you will need to set the initialValue parameter to an empty string
    so that future iterations can concatenate more string characters */

const codedInput = 'noggin oreo the moon time tele steed his tent apollo her lives though shoo tofu budapest';

// Convert input to array
function reduce(string) {
    let words = string.split(' ');
    let decoded = ' ';
    while()

    
    return;
